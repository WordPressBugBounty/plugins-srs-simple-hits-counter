Simple plugin to count and show a total number of hits (Unique visitors or page-views) to the site without using any third party code.

== Description ==

As the name suggests, it's a very simple Hit Counter that counts the number of Unique Visitors and Page-views. It's very light weight so it doesn't strain your site or cause render blocking.

You can show either Unique Visitors count or Page-views count anywhere on the site using widgets or shortcode. You can also add/show both Counters by using two copies of the widget or the shortcode. 

Note: It keeps counting even when you have no widget or shortcode active. To completely disable the counter you have to disable the plugin.

= Features =

* AJAX based counter ignores most bots or crawlers
* Monthly and weekly graph in admin
* Show the Unique Visitors, Page-views count or both
* Ability to reset the counter to any number any time
* Can be shown anywhere on the site using Widgets and Shortcode
* Counter works and shows data in admin even when no widget or short-code is active

= SHORTCODES =

[srs_total_visitors] for Unique Visitors
[srs_total_pageViews] for Page-views
